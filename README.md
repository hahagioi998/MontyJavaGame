Monty Java and the Holy Grail
=============

This is a 2D game project for an OOP class in Java, using the MVC design pattern.

##Game play
You are a part of King Arthur's Round Table and have one goal in life to find the Holy Grail.
For this, you will have to find it and more important, be brave enough to earn it ! 
During your quest, you will come accross people willing to help you and others to stop you.
One more thing ! You do not have much time, the police is looking after you.
You killed that historian, remember ...?

##How to play
The player plays alone with a knight (represented by the letter "p" for player) whose two main skills are fighting and joking.
When you launch the game, you are asked to choose your difficulty level. **to be implemented**
The difficulty level influences on the total of fighting and joking skill points the player begins with : more difficult, less skilled.

Now the game begins.
The player finds himself on a map, represented by tiles, and can move using the arrow keys, one tile by one.
The player can only see two tiles far around him, the rest hidden.
The goal is to reach the tile where the Holy Grail (represented by a "t" for trophy) is, and to be skilled enough (at least 15 fighting or joking skill points) to earn it and win.
